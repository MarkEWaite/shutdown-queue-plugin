    <i>"buildable overflowing": Shutdown mode is canceled for "Open queue time". During this time, buildable items can
        left the buildable queue in order to be executed. After "Open queue time", shutdown mode is turned back on.

    <p>
        <b>Default strategy</b><br>
        Creates a copy of the buildable queue and chooses items that satisfy conditions to overtake the frozen queue
        (whitelist). If there are any, the original buildable queue is cleared. After "buildable overflowing", items
        except whitelist are put back into the queue.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Remove longer strategy</b><br>
        Simply removes tasks from the queue whose estimated duration does not satisfy condition before
        "buildable overflowing".
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Sort and remove longer strategy</b><br>
        Sorts the queue by an estimated duration and a rest is the same as Remove longer strategy.
        Due to sorting at the beginning, more tasks might be executed in the same amount of time.
